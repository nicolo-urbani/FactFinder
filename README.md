## Abstract
The identification of what is real or artificially created is undoubtedly a crucial
issue in contemporary society. The advent of social media has accelerated the
dissemination of information, but at the same time, it has also led to the spread
of unverified facts, artificially created content, and misinformation that do not
correspond to reality, thus introducing artificial biases into society.
The task of fact-checking plays a fundamental role in ensuring the quality of
information, which extends beyond the boundaries of social media. In a context
where news can be distorted, manipulated, or even created ad hoc to influence
public opinion, fact-checking emerges as a tool of paramount importance in
keeping society informed and critical-thinking.
Although fact-checking is a necessity, according to a December 2021 Eurostat
survey [1], only 23% of individuals aged 16 to 74 had verified the accuracy of
information or content in the three months prior to the survey, despite 47% of
them encountering false or dubious information from news websites or social
media. Providing accurate information to support or refute a fact, therefore,
becomes a fundamental challenge that heavily involves research and can mitigate
their impact on society. Can an effective retrieval be part of the solution?
In this project, the focus is on retrieving verified facts based on a well-known
benchmark dataset: FEVER (Fact Extraction and Verification), Thorne et al.
2018 [2]. It is based on 185,445 manually annotated claims, categorizing them
into three categories: Supported, Refuted, or Not Enough Info. FEVER has
also become a reference dataset for IR and supports our goal: building a fact
retrieval system.
